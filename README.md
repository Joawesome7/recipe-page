## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Clamp()

### What I learned

I'm in day 3 of doing frontend mentor chalenge and to be honest doing css without frameworks is hard compare with frameworks but It's part of my commitment to learn things from the core

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  padding: clamp(0rem, 2vw, 2.5rem) clamp(0rem, 2vw, 2.5rem) 0;
}
```
